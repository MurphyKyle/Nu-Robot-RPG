	Arm: 4 - 8 tons
	Leg: 10 - 20 tons
	Torso: 10 - 15 tons
	Head: 2 - 5 tons
}

Health by torso : weight * 10, rarity increase same rarity boost(1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) multiplied

Speed Conversion by weight : 80 max speed, 40 min Speed, 60 / overall weight * 40, treads decrease by 25%, rarity boost multiplier
	
Attack Conversion : average arms weight and add rand of 0-4 , 2X super-effective based on type arm vs torso, 1/2X not-effective based on type arm vs torso
	rarity boost multiplier
Weak/Resist chart
Ballistic-Resistant: weak to beam and fire/resist ballistic and electricity
Beam-Resistant: weak to ballistic and electricity/resist beam and fire
Explosive is regular for all
